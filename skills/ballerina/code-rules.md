# Ballerina Code Rules

Everything in this file applies to **all** Ballerina code. Read it in full.

## Domain rules — read the ones your task needs

These are not optional extras; they are the rules for their domain, kept out of this file so you only load what applies. Read the matching file **before** writing that part of the code.

| Task involves | Read |
| ------------- | ---- |
| An HTTP service, or calling an HTTP API | [rules/http.md](rules/http.md) |
| A consumer for a broker or queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, JMS, …), or any listener that receives events — change-data-capture included | [rules/messaging.md](rules/messaging.md) |
| A database client, or SQL queries | [rules/sql.md](rules/sql.md) |
| A GraphQL service | write the schema first if the user has not given one, then name Ballerina records after its types |
| More than one package in the repo, or a service **plus** a `main` | [rules/workspace.md](rules/workspace.md) |
| Writing tests — only when the user asked for them | [rules/tests.md](rules/tests.md) |

## Structure

- Define `configurable` variables for all external values (API keys, hosts, ports, credentials).
  - Allowed types: `string`, `int`, `decimal`, `boolean` only.
  - Never assign hardcoded default values to configurables.
- Initialize clients at module level, before any function or service declarations.
- Declare listeners with the `listener` keyword (`listener foo:Listener lsn = new (config);`), not a `final` variable — `service ... on lsn` attachment requires it; a `final foo:Listener` fails to compile.
- A package may contain **both** a `main` function and services, and the startup ordering has consequences — see [rules/workspace.md](rules/workspace.md).

## Data

- Use records for all data structures. Never use `map<json>`, `map<anydata>`, or raw `json`.
- Prefer closed records (`record {| ... |}`) for data shapes you own. Use an open record only when tolerating extra/unknown fields is deliberate (e.g. a loosely-specified inbound payload).
- Never access or manipulate a `json` variable directly. Define a record, convert json to it (`cloneWithType()` or `fromJsonStringWithType()`), then use the record.
- If a return typedesc is marked `<>` in API docs, define a custom record for the expected data shape.
- If a parameter type is `record {|anydata...;|}`, define or reuse an explicit named record — do not pass an anonymous literal.
- If a return type is `record {|anydata...;|}`, decide the shape, declare a named record, and assign to it.
- Do not invoke a method on a field-access expression, and do not narrow an optional or union-typed field in place — assign the field to a typed variable first, then use that variable. Plain reads (`if order.status == "NEW"`) need no intermediate.

## Identifiers

- Always use **two-word camelCase** for ALL identifiers: variables, parameters, record fields (e.g., `userName`, `baseUrl`, `responseBody`).
- Exception: a record whose fields bind to external payload/JSON keys (e.g. via `cloneWithType()`) must use the **exact source key names** — even if that means single-word or PascalCase (e.g. `Name`, `CreatedDate`). The wire contract wins over the naming convention here.

## Function Calls

- Dot notation (`.`) for normal functions. Arrow notation (`->`) for remote and resource functions.
- Resource function invocation: `clientVar->/path/["param"].get(key="value")`
- Always use **named arguments**: `client->post("/path", message = payload)` — never positional.
- A remote call (`->`) may stand alone, be the whole right-hand side of an assignment, or be returned — `return c->get("/a");` is fine. It may **not** appear nested inside a larger expression: `io:println(check c->get("/a"))` fails with *action invocation as an expression not allowed here*. Assign it to a variable first.

## Type Safety

- Declare types explicitly in all variable declarations and `foreach` statements.
- To narrow a union or optional type: assign to a separate typed variable first, then use it in the `if` condition.
- Do not invoke methods on json access expressions — always use a separate statement.

## Imports

- Each `.bal` file must have its own import statements.
- Import only packages your code actually references — `bal build` errors on unused imports. Don't pre-import a connector's dependency module (e.g. `ballerina/sql` behind a database client) unless your code names a type from it. Exception: the SQL `.driver` packages (below) are deliberate side-effect-only imports — keep them even though they look unused.
- Do not import auto-imported langlibs: `lang.string`, `lang.boolean`, `lang.float`, `lang.decimal`, `lang.int`, `lang.map`.
- Packages with dots in names use aliases: `import org/package.one as one;`
- Submodules in `generated/<moduleName>/`: import as `import <packageName>.<moduleName>;` — the import should contain only the package name and submodule name, no path components.
- A SQL client needs its `.driver` package imported alongside it as a side-effect import — see [rules/sql.md](rules/sql.md).
- **Never hand-add a dependency to `Ballerina.toml`** — an `import` plus `bal build` resolves and downloads it from Central. `[[dependency]]` blocks are only for pinning a version or pointing at a local repository, and `[[platform.*.dependency]]` for Java JARs; see [troubleshooting/packages.md](troubleshooting/packages.md).
- **Never hand-edit `Dependencies.toml`** — the build tool manages it. Deleting it to force a clean re-resolution, then rebuilding, is a valid troubleshooting step.

## Config.toml

- `Config.toml` supplies `configurable` values at **run time**, not build time — a missing value fails the run, never the build.
- Only create or populate it as part of running or testing, not while writing the code.

## Logging & Observability

- Use the `ballerina/log` module for logging: `log:printInfo`, `log:printError`, `log:printWarn`, `log:printDebug`. Attach context as named key-value arguments rather than concatenating into the message string.
- Ballerina has built-in runtime observability (metrics + tracing) — enable it via `[ballerina.observe]` in `Config.toml`, or pass `--observability-included` to `bal run`/`bal build` (already set by `bal new`). Use `ballerina/observe` only for custom spans/metrics beyond the built-in instrumentation.

## File Organization

- Split code by concern across multiple `.bal` files rather than cramming everything into `main.bal` — files in a package share one module, so splitting is free; use submodules or packages for larger separation.
- Name new files for their concern (`snake_case.bal`). Naming and granularity are your call, not a fixed scheme.

## Other Rules

- Function parameters are immutable — assigning to one fails with *cannot assign a value to function argument*. Copy it into a local variable and modify that.
- Declare listeners and attach services statically at module level; do not register or attach them at runtime.
- Propagate errors with `check`, or handle them with a `do`/`on fail` block; never use `checkpanic` to silence an error return in real code.
- `//` is the only comment form — Ballerina has no `/* */` block comments (`invalid token '/*'`). `#` introduces documentation.
